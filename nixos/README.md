Much thanks to Tyler Kelley, "Best NixOS Config"
<https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos> for providing a guide. His YouTube video was
quite instructive; it is an excellent introduction to NixOS.

His waybar and starship configurations I stole without shame and modified (
statically; I'm not as interested in dynamic changes). Others took some
looking into.
